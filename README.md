# Workday-Scheduler-refactor-
## Description 
This is a refactor of a week day scheduler that was supposed to be dynamically coded using Javascript. When the user views the site now they are able to see the current day and I also included the current time as well, and each business hour for that day is displayed on the bottom of the page. Each hour must be color coordinated according whether its past, present, future, and it had to be that each time block changes colors in regards to the current time. Lastly the goal was to save user input in local storage and display the user input on the textarea box so it persist on the page even if the user were to refresh the page.

## Usage 
The usage for this application is to provide a user with a dynamically driven week day scheduler, that uses a dynamic build in order to provide a scheduler that runs on current time and updates according to the current hour. This application provides users with a way to plan their day with this application. This application uses dayjs libraries and jquery in order to make it functional, and it served a great way of learning to use dayjs libraries and jquery.
